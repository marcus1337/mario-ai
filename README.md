# Mario Experiments
Mario AI Framework code. For research purposes only. This project is not endorced by Nintendo.


There are two main folders of interest in this repository: neat-java-mario and python-projects. neat-java-swig-ports only contain code for porting C++ NEAT code with the Mario AI Framework. It also contains a pre-compiled DLL file which should work for Windows users that do not want to compile SWIG themselves. neat-java-mario contains the code used to test NEAT and python-projects the code used to test RL. Both of the test code folders contain their own variant of the Mario AI Framework which has been tailored to work correctly with C++ (NEAT) or Python (RL).
